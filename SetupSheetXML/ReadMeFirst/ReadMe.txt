This template is a standard C# class library project for use with Mastercam X9. The project 
has a reference to the NETHook3_0.dll located in the root directory of your Mastercam X9 installation. 
However, if you installed into a directory other than the default installation directory you may need to update the project 
reference to the NETHook3_0.dll in order for your project to compile.


The included ProjectSetup documents detail setup for building debuging a NETHook.

**NOTE: This NETHook class library targets the .NET 4.5 Framework x64 build.
**NOTE: Building will give a command copy error (post build step) until you rename the FT file to match that of your project
**NOTE: Make sure you are running Visual Studio in Administrator mode, see the ProjectSetup documents for instructions.
